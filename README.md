# matrix-pulse
An app that polls stock quotes and sends notification to your Awtrix clock when market is down. 

With stock price rockets to all time high, when is the best time to invest the uninvested cash?
1. Invest right now
2. DCA (dollar cost average) in
3. Wait till a good time

As described in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwR3nxojS0g, 2 and 3 are suboptimal compared to 1 based on historical data. That said, still some people go with 2 or 3 to have a more peace of mind.

This app turns your awtrix clock to a "good-time" notifier.
